# Locasite Todo List

## âœ… COMPLETED: Dual-Mode Website Builder Implementation

### Strategic Approach: Simple + Pro Mode System

**Core Decision**: Keep existing visual editor as "Pro Mode" (hidden initially) and create a new simplified "Simple Mode" as the default experience.

### Key Requirements

1. âœ… **Minimal schema changes** - Both systems work with existing data structures
2. âœ… **Seamless coexistence** - Users can switch between modes without data loss
3. âœ… **Simple Mode as default** - Non-technical users get streamlined experience
4. âœ… **Pro Mode preserved** - Advanced users retain full functionality (hidden)

---

## âœ… Phase 1: Simple Mode Foundation - COMPLETED

### âœ… Step 1: Create Simple Builder Architecture

**New Components Structure**

```
app/components/simple-builder/
â”œâ”€â”€ core/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ simple-editor.tsx          # Main simple editor wrapper
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ section-selector.tsx       # Visual section picker
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ mode-switcher.tsx          # Toggle between Simple/Pro
â”œâ”€â”€ sections/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ section-library.ts         # Hardcoded section definitions
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ section-renderer.tsx       # Renders sections in simple mode
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ section-variations.ts      # Pre-built section variations
â”œâ”€â”€ ui/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ section-card.tsx          # Section preview cards
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ inline-editor.tsx         # Simple text/image editing
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ style-controls.tsx        # Basic color/font controls
â””â”€â”€ types/
    â””â”€â”€ simple-builder.ts         # Type definitions
```

**Data Structure (Compatible with existing schema)**

```typescript
// Extends existing ComponentData to work with both systems
interface SectionVariation {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  preview: string; // Base64 or URL to preview image
  category: "hero" | "about" | "services" | "gallery" | "contact" | "footer";
  components: ComponentData[]; // Reuses existing component structure
  editableFields: {
    [componentId: string]: string[]; // Which fields can be edited
  };
}

interface SimplePageData {
  mode: "simple" | "pro";
  sections: {
    id: string;
    variationId: string;
    customData?: Record<string, any>; // User customizations
  }[];
  // Existing page data structure remains unchanged
  components?: ComponentData[]; // For pro mode compatibility
}
```

### âœ… Step 2: Section Library Creation - COMPLETED

**Hardcoded Section Variations (No database changes needed)**

- [x] **Hero Sections** (3 variations):

  - Center-aligned with background image
  - Split-screen layout
  - Minimal text-only

- [x] Create conversion functions between modes
- [x] Implement data preservation during switches
- [x] Add warning dialogs for complexâ†’simple conversion

**Conversion Logic**

```typescript
// Convert Pro mode (ComponentData[]) to Simple mode sections

// Convert Simple mode sections back to Pro mode components
function convertSimpleToProMode(sections: SectionData[]): ComponentData[];
```

- [x] Pro tab hidden by default (feature flag controlled)
- [x] Add smooth transition between modes
- [x] Preserve user data during switches

### âœ… Step 2: Data Compatibility Layer

- [x] Ensure Simple mode sections convert cleanly to ComponentData[]
- [x] Maintain existing visual editor functionality unchanged
- [x] Create migration utilities for existing pages

- [x] Suggest relevant section types based on business category
- [x] Pre-fill contact information across sections
- [x] Import business photos to gallery sections

### âœ… Step 2: Business Type Presets

**Preset Definitions** (Using section variations)

```typescript
interface BusinessPreset {
  type:
    | "restaurant"
    | "salon"
    | "medical"
    | "professional"
    | "retail"
    | "automotive";
  name: string;
  description: string;
  defaultSections: {
    variationId: string;
    order: number;
    autoPopulate?: boolean;
  }[];
}
```

- [x] **Restaurant**: Hero, Menu/Services, Gallery, Contact
- [x] **Salon/Beauty**: Hero, Services, Gallery, About, Contact
- [x] **Medical**: Hero, Services, About, Contact
- [x] **Professional**: Hero, About, Services, Contact
- [x] **Retail**: Hero, Products, Gallery, Contact
- [x] **Automotive**: Hero, Services, Gallery, About, Contact

### âœ… Step 3: Onboarding Flow

## ðŸ“‹ Phase 5: Implementation Details

### Database Schema (Minimal Changes)

**Existing `pages` table - Add optional fields:**

```typescript
// Add to existing schema
interface Page {
  // ... existing fields
  editorMode?: "simple" | "pro"; // Default: 'simple'
  simpleSections?: {
    id: string;
    variationId: string;
    customData?: Record<string, any>;
    order: number;
  }[];
}
```

### File Structure Changes

**New Files** (No modifications to existing visual editor)

```
app/components/simple-builder/     # New simple builder system
app/lib/simple-builder-utils.ts    # Conversion utilities
app/types/simple-builder.ts        # Type definitions
```

**Modified Files** (Minimal changes)

```
app/components/business/business-page-renderer.tsx  # Add simple mode rendering
app/[domain]/page.tsx                              # Route to appropriate editor
convex/pages.ts                                    # Add simple mode fields
```

### Rollout Strategy

**Phase 1**: Simple mode for new sites only
**Phase 2**: Migration tool for existing sites  
**Phase 3**: Pro mode reveal (feature flag or paid tier)
**Phase 4**: Template system cleanup (after validation)

## ðŸŽ¯ RECOMMENDED STRATEGY

Based on your goals, I recommend:

### 1. **Section-Based Builder as Primary Interface**

- Much simpler than current block editor
- Still flexible with multiple variations per section
- Easier to maintain than massive template files
- Better for non-technical users

### 2. **Business Type Presets Instead of Full Templates**

- Smaller, more maintainable preset definitions
- Auto-populated with business data
- Easier to add new business types
- Less code duplication

### 3. **Two-Tier System (Simple + Pro)**

- Simple mode for 80% of users (small business owners)
- Pro mode for 20% who need advanced features
- Allows you to serve both markets
- Can be separate pricing tiers

### 4. **Focus on Smart Defaults**

- Leverage Google Business data for auto-population
- Use AI for content suggestions
- Provide industry-specific recommendations
- Minimize user decision fatigue

This approach would:

- âœ… Dramatically reduce code complexity
- âœ… Make the product accessible to non-technical users
- âœ… Maintain flexibility for power users
- âœ… Be much easier to maintain and extend
- âœ… Provide clear upgrade path to Pro features
